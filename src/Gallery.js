    /*When creating callback into React engine, variable are already defined in closure.
    So when we set the callback to increment the index initially, the index variable is set to 0.
    It gets a chance to increment that index to 1 on a re-render.But we are not refiring the effect.
    So the interval that is running is still firing the callback that was sent off and created with that initial
    first render.Therefore that original interval will always see that original index at zero initially
    when it fires off that callback. SYNTAX provided by React for the setter function to force React to pull the latest value.
    On utilise storedIndex so setIndex uses the latest value storedIndex of the state variable rather than the index as it was defined when the callback was created
